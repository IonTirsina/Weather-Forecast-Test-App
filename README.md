This is a very simple example application. It's a weather forecast API that generates a fake weather forecast for a week, a month, and a custom period.
The task:

1) carefully review the application source code and try to find as many issues as possible. Check different areas. 
   Is the API consforms to the REST standard? Does the app layout looks ok? How the app handles incoming data? Any other issues?
2) fix all found issues and commit your fixes to git. Try to create small, focused commits. Explain your reasoning in commit messages.

Good luck!
